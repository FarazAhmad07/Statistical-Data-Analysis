    "Problem Description:\n",
    "Suppose we have a delivery company with a fleet of three vehicles tasked with delivering packages to six customers from a central depot. Each customer has a specific demand representing the number of packages to be delivered, and there are known distances between each pair of customers and the depot.\n",

    "The algorithm implemented in the provided Python code for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is the Parallel Cheapest Insertion (PCI) algorithm. This algorithm is one of the strategies available in Google OR-Tools for solving VRP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the PCI algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Initialization:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The algorithm starts with an empty solution and iteratively adds customers to the routes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.Insertion:\n",
    "    \n",
    "At each step, it selects the customer that can be inserted into the existing solution at the lowest cost.\n",
    "The cost of insertion is determined by evaluating the impact of adding the customer to different positions in the current routes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.Parallelism:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The algorithm explores multiple potential insertions in parallel, considering different vehicles and different positions within each route.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.Cheapest Insertion:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The customer is inserted at the position that results in the least increase in the total cost of the solution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5.Termination:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The algorithm terminates when all customers have been inserted into the routes, and no further improvements can be made.\n",
    "The PCI algorithm is efficient for small to medium-sized VRP instances and can produce high-quality solutions. It balances exploration of different insertion possibilities with the objective of minimizing the total distance traveled by the vehicles."
